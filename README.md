# Interview Scheduler API

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Creating The DB

Use the `psql -U development` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `development` and the password `development`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE madcap_development;`.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.development` and fill in the necessary PostgreSQL configuration. The `node-postgres` library uses these environment variables by default.

```
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=development
PGDATABASE=madcap_development
PGPASSWORD=development
PGPORT=5432
```

## Seeding


Run a the development server with `npm start` in the Host environment. We are only using vagrant for `psql` this week.

Both of these achieve the same result.

Use the npm run `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.

*** login to correct db AND user! :))) ***
for access in terminal
`psql -d mydb -U myuser`

## Run The Server

Running the server normally
```sh
npm start
```

Running the server so it returns an error when saving/deleting for testing the client's error handling capabilities
```sh
npm run error
```
